# 3DArrrays
Convert 2D tabular or matrix data into a 3D array suitable for use with CNN, LSTM, RNN, etc..

The purpose of this library is have a re-usable and performant 3D Array converter to aide in the formation of inputs needed for algorithms requiring 3 dimenstional array input.  The ideal state is to  call one function that will return an array or array of lists depending on parameters passed overiding defaults.
